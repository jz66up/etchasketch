# Etch-A-Sketch

Before my Readme, here is my [Live Weblink](https://jz66up.github.io/etchasketch/). This project is about replicating a online game

## What I learnt from said project

1. How to make an array by using the `Array.from()` function 


2. the `if` format in javascript is different from other coidng languages


3. `innerText` lets you write text in Javascript

4. The new `grid` method in CSS
5. how to use CSS in `Javascript`

```js
secondcontainerEl.style.gridTemplateRows = `repeat(${numberperside}, 1fr)`;
```
6. The `repeat` function in `grid` allows a large number of rows or columns to be created efficiently when all the column sizes are the same
7. Always use  `===`  in `Javascript`

# Ideas for future development
I can make a slider to control the number of squares on the grid to drawings can be more precise.
